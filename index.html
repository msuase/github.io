      <h1>Monica Likes Cats</h1>
    <p>Even though I do not have pets, I <strong>LOVE</strong> cats! For the most part they are low maintenance, 
        and do not have the same in your face energy as dogs do. I think that anyone looking to own a pet that can 
        give cuddles but does not need to be walked should get a cat. <a href=https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Community-Development/Animal-Care/Adoptions/Adopt-A-Cat>Adoption</a>
        is a great way to give a cat a new home and achieve a forever friend! Since I do not have the means of being a cat owner yet, I encourage you
        to live out my dreams and get one yourself. I will be forever <strong>jealous!</strong>
